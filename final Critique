Anthony - His project was a game. He used both processeing and arduino make it. 
I liked how he used processing for the imagery of the game and arduino for the buttons
that lights up. The game gives the user a chance to win $1,000,000 if all questions are 
answered correctly. If not the user has a chance to try again.


Micheal Paul - His project was a safe. though he had a few techincal difficulties.
i found his project to be interseting only in the sence of how he made it. The safe is 
light sensitive. There are LED's that indicate the combination is right or wrong. 

Brian - I like how he used processing to make his final project. when you press a certain
key it will affect the image and create a sound and you can mak a beat with it. 

Timmothy - created three LED cubes and put one cube in seperate containors so that when 
you put your hand over the photo cell it will turn each of the cubes on. 

Fane - She used both arduino and processing to make her project. i like the fact as the 
value of the potineometer grew it will draw a image on the screen. but when it decreases 
the image will disapear.
